# Smart City Issue Tracker – Frontend

The **Smart City Issue Tracker (Frontend)** is a modern web application built with **Vite, React (JavaScript), and Material-UI**.  
It enables citizens to **report city infrastructure issues**, staff to **manage and resolve tasks**, and administrators to **monitor and assign work** — all through role-based dashboards.

## Project Overview

Urban infrastructure issues such as potholes, streetlight failures, or sanitation problems often go untracked or unresolved due to lack of transparency.  
The **Smart City Issue Tracker** solves this by offering a **digital platform** where:

- Citizens can report issues and track progress.  
- Staff can view assigned tasks, mark them as resolved, and provide proof of completion.  
- Admins can assign issues, monitor real-time updates, and maintain accountability.  

This ensures a **transparent, efficient, and citizen-friendly solution** to civic issue management.
